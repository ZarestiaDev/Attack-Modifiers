# Attack-Modifiers
This is an extension for Fantasy Grounds Unity, usable with the ruleset 3.5E and PFRPG.

What this extension does:
- Seperate subwindow above weapon in the actions tab which is only shown in "Combat" mode
- All attack modifiers (all I know of in 3.5E) with the corresponding plus and minus
- Only modifiers which work together can be selected together
- Check wether the attack is melee or ranged (Shoot [into] Melee) doesn't work on melee attacks
- New hopefully bit more modern buttons which change on the theme you are using (see below)

What the extension does not yet:
- Extra logic besides attack is currently not working as I'd like it to (e.g. cover giving +2 reflex saves). I will get around that eventually.
